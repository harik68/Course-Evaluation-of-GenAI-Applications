456d8e5033ddfcf0a78f931b696804f94972f639,"(CNN)Be afraid -- be very afraid. This is the warning the world deserves to hear. Because the leader of the free world refuses to look with clear eyes at the chief security challenges of the 21st century: the fruits of radical Islam. The results of the Obama White House's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever-growing numbers of victims of radical Islam in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia. Not to mention here in the United States, Canada and Europe. Is it not a tragic irony that the Arab Spring-era policies of a Nobel Peace Prize recipient accommodated the transition of Syria into the world's newest jihad theater while leaving Libya a failed state and Yemen a failing state? The Syrian jihad gave rise to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which now uses Syria as a rear operating base to support its jihad in Iraq, which could soon spill over into Jordan. Plus, Libya is now being used as a rear operating base by ISIS and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the Middle East, even as they plan attacks in Europe and North America. Given the frightfully slow pace America's commander-in-chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both ISIS and its progenitor, al Qaeda, the picture of what's in store is clear: The body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy-in for their agendas. And neither the United States nor our Western allies are immune to this cancer. Academics who must say something new or different to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of ISIS and al Qaeda as distinctly different. But the fact is they are not -- their agendas, which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today, are manifestations of radical Islam. Of course, it's hardly a surprise President Barack Obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven naïve, with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is, but as they hope it could be. There is no shortage of examples that highlight the absence of sound foresight on the parts of the world's most powerful politician and his national security team. Just take the National Strategy for Counterterrorism published by the White House in 2011. That document contained the assertion that, ""Since the beginning of 2011, the transformative change sweeping North Africa and the Middle East -- along with the death of Osama bin Laden -- has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat, par-ticularly as the relevance of al Qaeda and its ideology has been further diminished."" Yet, fast forward to January 2014 and America's top intelligence official, director of National Intelligence James Clapper, advised Congress that al Qaeda was no less capable of threatening the United States and our allies than a decade earlier. Soon after Clapper acknowledged al Qaeda was not a band on the run, as President Obama had described the terrorist enterprise, a report by terrorism expert Seth Jones of the RAND Corporation highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the White House:  As restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like Libya, Tunisia and Egypt during the Arab Spring, those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups -- including al Qaeda and groups aligned with it. According to data compiled by Jones, from 2010 through 2013, the number of Salafi jihadist groups increased by 58%. These groups are fueled by Salafiyya Jihadiyya, an ideology that not only informs the agenda of al Qaeda, but is the source code for the agenda of the al Qaeda offshoot ISIS. Most recently, absent from the National Security Strategy produced by the Obama White House in February 2015 is any real meaningful discussion concerning threats posed by al Qaeda. Yes, Osama bin Laden was killed on President Obama's watch. But contrary to what the White House seemed to think in 2011, bin Laden's death has not lifted the shadow he casts over America's, or our allies' security. Indeed, within days of our new National Security Strategy's publication date, in the seventh issue of ISIS's English-language magazine Dabiq, the group's leaders described their jihad as a continuation of the jihad charted by bin Laden, while accusing his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, of steering al Qaeda off the path of its former leader. Meanwhile, Yemen -- home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the al Qaeda branch that claimed credit for the January 2015 attack in Paris at the office of Charlie Hebdo -- has also become a failed state. AQAP is helmed by the second-highest-ranking official in al Qaeda writ large, and the Obama administration views it as the most dangerous component of al Qaeda's global network. So it is interesting that, in the months before the Yemeni government was overthrown by Iran-backed rebels, President Obama described the U.S.-Yemen counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against al Qaeda -- interesting because the President did not do more to help that ""partner"" government remain in power. Once again, the president and his advisers appear to have either ignored or failed to recognize the trajectory of events in the Middle East. What were they thinking? And how do they plan to combat AQAP now? Despite what the White House wants the world to believe, a sober look at the security environment reveals the following key realities: . ISIS controls a large amount of territory in the Middle East, and the group is rapidly growing its ranks in places such as Libya and Afghanistan, while at the same time inspiring and plotting attacks in the West. And, although ISIS is trying to ""out al Qaeda"" al Qaeda, resorting to attention winning stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world, al Qaeda itself is no less of a threat to the United States and our allies today than it was in January 2014. At the same time, the routine failures of President Obama and his advisers to understand the security environment, and to appropriately tailor America's national security posture in a manner demanded by it, foretells more disasters lie ahead. Not only Americans, but also our allies should be very, very afraid. Indeed, President Obama's refusal to simply call a problem like radical Islam by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating radical Islamist groups. History has shown the dangers that millions can be placed in if our leaders don't face down a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our full weight behind efforts to vanquish it. President Obama has the resources at his disposal to do just that. But if he wants to help define a future for the Middle East and North Africa in which fewer threats emanate from those regions, he must spend more time listening to talented professionals in our military and intelligence community versus the idealists and yes-men surrounding him at the White House. There is too much at stake in the near term to continue down the path of experimentation with Pollyannaish theories about how to attain this future that have actually rendered us less safe. Indeed, President Obama should also pay closer attention to what representatives from Arab states are saying behind closed doors. Most of their bosses would love to be the claimants to the prize of defeating ISIS and al Qaeda. However, all of them recognize that, unless we all want things to get a whole lot worse before they might get any better, the United States will have to deploy considerably more of our ""kinetic"" resources to put those victories in sight. This does not mean a ground forces-intensive response is required from us at this time. But if the President thinks it prudent to wait on our Arab partners to do most of the heavy lifting, he could be guaranteeing this will be the case in the not-too-distant future.","Authors warn President Obama must be clear about radical Islam threat .

But in a bid to shed its image as the home of the mundane run-around, the company has launched its very own supercar. With the first models already shipped to China, the  GT, will be unrolled across Europe next year. While Ford has refused to officially confirm its price, bosses have indicated it will run alongside the £260,000 Lamborghini Aventador. To herald its launch, the company's design team have created a stunning light sculpture which showcases how they came about creating the prototype. Ford showcased its £260,000 GT in a stunning light installation in the heart of Milan as the first models are shipped to China . The light sculpture was unveiled in the  Piazza de Fidele on Tuesday as part of Milan Design Week . Planted in Milan's Piazza de Fidele, it walked through the steps of rendering to give insight into the car's conception. In the heart of one of the world's most design-savvy cities, many were surprised to learn the piece had been produced by car designers and engineers, said bosses. '(Having an artwork) is something new for us but really it combined everything that we do everyday,' said Moray Callum, Ford's Vice President of design. 'The model making, the technology - all of that was done in house so it's just taking what we do and presenting it in a different way.' 'We, generally, are a car company that talks to car guys but we wanted to reach a wider audience. 'We've had people approaching the installation and asking ""this is Ford?!"" which is just great. 'People were shocked that we were doing this and that's what we wanted to hear.' Alongside the modern artwork, Ford has released some of the first impressions of what the GTs interior will look like. The artwork was composed by Ford designers who worked on the concept for the £260,000 GT . The interactive installation was placed in Milan's Piazza de Fidele where it remained throughout design week . With its exterior a combination of aluminium and carbon-fibre, the compact two-seater has all the hallmarks of its ultra-sleek competitors. And earmarked at around the same price as the Lamborghini Aventador, the GT is a far cry from the much-loved models which keeps the company afloat. But despite a drive towards luxury, bosses insist the company is not trying to breakaway from its most reliable consumer. 'As long as I'm around, the mum on the school run will remain important - but design is important for her too,' added Mr Callum. Speaking at Milan's Salone de Mobile - an annual showcase of the world's leading furniture and light designers - he continued: 'Generally we are a car company that talks to car guys but we want to reach a wider audience. 'Design has always been important but we're finding you need to expand your audience.' The model was showcased for the first time at the International Auto Show in Detroit earlier this year (above) The car has up-swinging doors and 600 horsepower. It was unveiled in January in Detroit to a rapturous reception . The first images of the interior of the Ford GT have been revealed after 100 of the supercars were shipped to China . While the vehicle won't reach European markets until next year, bosses say they have been 'pleased' with the reaction the car . While the GT is priced out of most's grasp, another of its most advanced vehicles could be brought to the masses, he added. Ford's version of a driverless car is in the final stages of production with just safety legislation and measure standing between it and the open road. 'We have autonomous cars that we've been working on for the past 20 years in Detroit. A lot of the technology is there for about 90 per cent of driving,' added Mr Callum. 'What we're working on now is that extra 10 per cent which will take into account whether there are road works or if there's been an accident (and it's not registered).'","Ford unveiled its GT earlier this year to the surprise of industry experts .

48fd45bb3d55b8b07b4c5034a97cd27b72b69af0,"You’ve found the house of your dreams – but you want to make sure the costly nightmare of dry rot isn’t lurking under the carpets and skirting boards. The solution? Call in the dogs! The appropriately named Mark Doggett has trained his two animals to sniff out the destructive fungus in old houses where it can hide in places a person would miss. Mr Doggett gave up a ten-year career in construction after hitting on the idea to set up a business using the animals’ sense of smell, which is said to be up to a million times better than that of humans. Skilled: Meg and Jess, pictured with Mark Doggett, were trained for six months to sniff out dry rot . On the case: Four-year-old Border collie Meg gets down to work sniffing out the destructive fungus . When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal . After six months of training, four-year-old border collie Meg and 22-month-old English springer spaniel Jess went to work. When they find dry rot they stop, stare at it and point with their nose, only moving from the affected area when Mr Doggett gives them a special signal. The businessman, 30, from Wolverhampton, whose company is called Enviro-Dogs, said: ‘We’re unique in offering a dry rot detection service using dogs to the public. The dogs can go out to domestic properties or surveyors can hire us as part of their report. Dry rot is wood decay caused by the fungus Serpula lacrymans that digests the parts of the wood which give it strength. By the time there are visible signs, serious damage will have been done. It begins as a microscopic spore but the final stage is a fruiting body which pumps out new spores. Once airborne they can damage all parts of a property, penetrating brickwork and concrete floors seeking a wood source. If not treated, it can destroy a building. “It’s not really work for the dogs – they see it as the best game in the world and they enjoy it because it’s working on their natural instincts. The dogs are so effective because they can detect dry rot at much earlier stages. ‘In hidden places dry rot can grow for years without anyone noticing it. It can be hard to find but the dogs can detect it through carpet and wall panelling. ‘It takes a couple of minutes for the dog to search a room. People are slightly dubious when they first hear about us but after seeing what we can do they’re amazed.’ Prices start at £200 for a call-out and the business has been so successful Mr Doggett plans to expand it by training the dogs to hunt out bed bugs for hotels and hospitals.

1f42cfb9302d4528339099a361998a892f3cac5e,"All the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics . Out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in South Wales, the trade union firebrand's manner was as warm as the weather. 'Didn't you once call me a slab-faced Marxist?' the famously militant leader of Unite asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing. I had to confess I had. But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause. Watching him in action, it was clear that he is highly popular with activists. His gospel of traditional hard-left socialism goes down well with the converted, as does his hackneyed anti-Conservative bile. 'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose. Indeed, McCluskey, a former Liverpool dock worker who keeps a drawing of Lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss, is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom: 'We are supposed to believe that the Seventies was a horrible time. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. Labour's umbilical link to McCluskey's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing, anti-austerity SNP, yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country. Not only is Unite – which has a claimed membership of 1.42million – intertwined with the Labour Party's structure, MPs and finances, but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past, including a major expansion in the public sector, less flexibility in the workplace, higher taxation and ever more state spending. Just like Nicola Sturgeon, McCluskey wants to make Labour bolder, 'more radical, courageous and brave'. Only last month, he appeared to threaten illegal action if a Tory Government pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector. 'When the law is misguided, when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question, I'm giving the answer. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. Despite all his talk about the oppression of working people, however, he has not done badly for himself. Last year it was revealed he received a £5,000 rise, taking his pay and pensions package to £140,281. McCluskey has denied that he has too much influence over Ed Miliband, adding that Unite is supporting the party '100 per cent' McCluskey's determination to influence Labour was all too evident in Wales. With an air of quasi-regal grandeur, he visited several factories, gave talks to Labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities – including one in Cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist Nye Bevan. When I spoke to McCluskey, he downplayed his hardline socialism, instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy. And he denied that he had too much influence over Ed Miliband's party: 'If only that were true,' he said, while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. As I watched him at close quarters, it became more apparent that he was going through the motions. When asked in an interview with BBC Radio Wales about Miliband's leadership, McCluskey could say only: 'He's doing OK'. Beneath the surface, I have no doubt he longs to hear Ed offering more nakedly socialist policies, rather than trying to appeal to Middle England. Moreover, if Labour and Unite really think that McCluskey is an asset in the election, they are doing their best to keep quiet about it. When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. No one would give me any information. It was only through persistence and good luck that I managed to track him down, to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally: 'How did you find us? Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' That kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence. It reveals a fear that, just as with Sturgeon's spendthrift radicalism, the hard-Left dogma of Unite is likely to alienate floating middle-of-the-road voters. Such fears are, of course, only too justified. For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David, who enjoyed greater popularity among Labour MPs and the rank and file. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least £14.4million to Labour's coffers. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband (pictured left) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David (right) The dominance of Unite runs right through Labour's organisation, with huge implications for the make-up of a putative Miliband government. One recent analysis showed that 159 Labour MPs from the last parliament receive sponsorship from Unite or are members of the union, including senior frontbenchers such as Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite. As Martin Mayer, chairman of Unite's political committee and a member of Labour's National Executive recently admitted, the union is involved in a 'serious attempt to win back the party'. Tragically for Britain, there is now a real danger that an incoming Labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the Left, not just by SNP by also by Unite, with Miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in Downing Street.","The scale of influence Unite holds is chilling given what it seeks to impose .

3aa1c387a889b27e17f17c7ac9b6779f20a78eed,"A 36-year-old Louisiana sheriff's deputy was directing traffic near a school zone this morning when he was ambushed and shot three times in what has been described as a road rage incident sparked by an argument over traffic. St. Charles Parish Sheriff Greg Champagne says Cpl. Burt Hazeltine was directing school buses on US 90 near Louisiana Street in the town of Paradis, just west of New Orleans, when he was gunned down. A male suspect, later identified as former Transportation Safety Administration worker 56-year-old Paul Devillier, was arrested a short time later after a brief 'tussle' with officers. Scroll down for video . Paul Devillier (left), 56, is accused of opening fire on Cpl. Burt Hazeltine (right) as he was directing traffic in a school zone in suburban New Orleans . Hero cop: Hazeltine, 36, with St Charles Parish (pictured here with his wife and four children), was shot three times in the face, elbow and eye Thursday morning . Bloody crime scene: The ambush took place on US 90 near Louisiana Street in the town of Paradis, just west of New Orleans. A deputy is seen swabbing what appears to be blood from the door of Hazeltine's squad car . Champagne says at around 9.15am, the shooter pulled up to a convenience store , got out of his 2014 Chevy Silverado pickup and opened fire on Hazeltine, who was hit in the face, elbow and eye. One of the bullets reportedly penetrated his lung. Another bullet lodged behind his eye, and the 36-year-old law enforcement officer may be at risk of losing his sight. Hazeltine is believed to have returned fire, but it was unclear whether Paul Devillier was wounded. Champagne says Hazeltine was in stable but guarded condition at Interim LSU Hospital Thursday afternoon. Two nearby schools, R.J. Vial Elementary and J.B. Martin Middle School, were briefly placed on lockdown after the shooting. Devillier had two weapons on him at the time of his arrest. Police say he does not have a criminal record but they suspect he suffers from mental health issues. Road rage: Devillier allegedly got into a verbal spat with Hazeltine because the deputy refused to stop traffic and allow his 2014 chevy Silverado (pictured) to make a turn . Worried for their comrade: Authorities walk outside LSU Interim Hospital, where Hazeltine was listed in guarded but stable condition . Burt Hazeltine was alert as he was being transported to the hospital, and according to Sheriff Champagne, he even cracked a joke in the ambulance about his ordeal, reported NOLA.com. Despite his severe injuries, the sheriff said a nurse attending to Hazeltine told him he 'got lucky.' During a press conference Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Champagne revealed that before the shooting, Devillier got into a verbal spat with Hazeltine because the deputy refused to stop traffic and allow him to make a left turn onto Louisiana Avenue, reported Fox 8. According to officials, Devillier then went to his father's home and called the sheriff's office, claiming to be an NCIS agent and demanding to speak to Sheriff Champagne. He then drove back to the Time Saver convenience store and called over Cpl Hazeltine, who was still directing traffic. When the deputy approached Devillier’s truck, he spotted a gun on the dashboard, pulled his service weapon and demanded the drive show his hands. Survivor: Hazeltine, pictured left with his wife, Mandy, was in stable but guarded condition at Interim LSU Hospital. There is a concern he may go blind in one eye . Happy family: Hazeltine and his wife have been married for nearly 14 years and have two sons and two daughters together (pictured) Career officer: The 36-year-old has been on the force for about 15 years, most recently serving in the traffic division . That is when investigators say the 56-year-old opened fire on Hazeltine. Little is known about the suspect at this time, but sheriff's officials said he was fired from TSA in 2013 and got a divorce that same year. Burt Hazeltine has been on the force about 15 years, serving in the traffic division. The deputy and his wife of nearly 14 years, Mandy, have two sons and two daughters. Those who know the couple described them to The Advocate as devout Christians who are very active in their community.","Cpl.

ce066d9c86b56b0bab4415046232628b8a6aa6c3,"Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy hailed the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of players after a determined 1-1 draw at his former club Wolves moved Town closer to securing a place in the SkyBet Championship play-offs. Despite Wolves bouncing back to take a point through Benik Afobe's 31st goal of the season in the 50th minute after a Richard Stearman own goal had given Ipswich a first-half lead, Town's play-off hopes are now in their own hands with two games remaining. Former Wolves boss McCarthy was delighted with his side's determined display and he said: 'It was a good performance and a good point. It is very pleasing. Mick McCarthy's Ipswich were denied three points as rivals Wolves fought back to draw 1-1 on Saturday . 'Wolves were in the ascendancy in the second half but we have had a great, stubborn, belligerent, professional performance - all those horrible words people don't like in football but I do because you win games and win leagues by doing that. 'We are always hard to beat and hard to play against. 'The first thing I said to the players in the dressing room after the game was what a belligerent, stubborn, hard working, tough, horrible bunch you have turned out to be and I love you and I am proud of you because you need all those qualities to be a good team. It is lovely to have. 'A lot of those qualities are probably the reasons why we are where we are. 'It takes a lot of things to be in the top six and there will be teams below us who are all playing sexy football but we are winning games and we are in the top six and we still have a chance of being promoted. 'So to anyone who cocks a snook at the way we are doing it I laugh at them and think it is comical because I think what we do we do well and isn't that what having a job is all about?' Tommy Smith's header (right) rebounds off Wolves defender Richard Stearman for an own goal . McCarthy, who was sacked by Wolves in February 2012 after almost six years in charge of the club, insisted that he did not have anything to prove on his second return to Molineux. He added: 'I think I am very much liked and respected by the Wolves fans and I love the club and the people here so I don't think I have got anything to prove and I always appreciate getting a nice warm welcome coming back. 'But I have taken the point and I am happy with that.' Although they trailed at the break, Wolves needed only five minutes of the second period to draw level when Afobe stabbed home at the far post and they could have gone on to snatch a winner with Nouha Dicko carrying their greatest. McCarthy hails the 'belligerent, stubborn and hard working' qualities of his 'horrible bunch' of Ipswich players . They could not find a second goal, though, and their play-off hopes are now hanging by a thread. However, coach Kenny Jackett insisted they will not be throwing in the towel. He said: 'It is out of our hands and now we will need to win our final two games and other teams will need to lose. But you don't know what will happen. So we need to make sure that we go again next week. 'It is a tough call, we understand that. We will have to see how the table looks but one way or another we have to put in a good performance and give it everything we have got next week at Wigan. Kenny Jackett is still hopeful his Wolves side can secure a Championship play-off spot despite the 1-1 draw . 'If the door is still open through other people slipping up we have to make sure that we are there.' He added: 'We gave it everything against Ipswich. I thought that we showed a lot of spirit, effort and energy in the second half when we pushed Ipswich all the way. The attitude and tempo was there.' 'Ultimately it is a better point for Ipswich than it is for us. We needed to win and I felt that we built up very well in the second half. We got a goal back early on but couldn't break down a very determined and well organised and resolute Ipswich defence. 'The number of times that they got blocks in was high and for us not to break them down in that period was our undoing so I am disappointed with the draw. We needed three points but Ipswich are very, very resolute.'","Ipswich denied three points as Wolves fight back to draw 1-1 on Saturday .

The blunder at the pensions office in Essen, in the North Rhine-Westphalia area of Germany saw a letter sent out the woman asking for £3,351,978,728,190,661. The bill is more than a thousands times than the whole of Germany's annual gross domestic product. How much is one quadrillion? This graphic shows what one quadrillion pennies would look like stacked on top of each other. The block would dwarf the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the Empire State Building and London's Shard . The £3.35 billion is also enough to pay the UK government debt nearly 2,000 times over. In fact, the customer's real contributions should only have been around a few hundred pounds. A quadrillion, is a thousand times one trillion, (a million times a million) in the American system. So a quadrillion is ten to the power of 15 or 1,000,000,000,000,000. In the British system, one quadrillion is ten to the power of 24 or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. However, in most English speaking countries, including the UK, the American system is the accepted. A spokesman for the office said the mistake was made when a pensions office worker accidentally copied a customer number into the form, rather than the amount outstanding. 'Yes, the letter did in fact go out like that,' pensions office spokesman Wolfgang Buschfort confirmed to The Local on Wednesday. 'As far as I know, this is the only time anyone has been called on to make such a large incorrect payment. The error was spotted before the office attempted to debit the massive sum from the bank account of the woman, from the Schwarzwald in Baden-Württemberg. Mr Buschfort added that with 26,000 employees working at the pensions office, mistakes were inevitable. The only evidence of the blunder that remained was the eye watering 16 figure demand letter.

A geography graduate has applied for more than 500 jobs - but has not been called for a single interview. Huw Davies, 34, has been searching for permanent employment for almost 13 years since graduating from the University of Glamorgan in 2002. As well as his BSc (hons) degree, Mr Davies, who lives in Merthyr Tydfil, also has three A-levels and 10 GCSEs on his CV. Despite his strong academic background, he has been unable to secure a job and says he 'hasn't got the foggiest' about what he is doing wrong. Although he has worked over the 13-year period, all the jobs have been on short, fixed-term contracts. He has also spent time teaching in South Africa, Kuwait and the desert kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but says he returned home as he wants to live in the UK. All this has meant he has been forced to dig deep into his savings to pay the rent and other bills. Scroll down for video . He said: 'It's unbelievable and no-one can understand it. 'Everyone I've spoken to - people in business, the job centre, my friends and family just don't know why I don't even get interviews. 'The sheer fact I have moved three times to work should imply I am eager to work. 'It's hard to blame anyone without being able to put my finger on the issue in the first place.' Searching: Mr Davies has a geography degree and three A-levels, but has not even been called for interview . Mr Davies initially wanted to find a job related to his degree, specifically employment within the environmental or town planning sectors. But after his numerous setbacks, the 34-year-old is now willing to settle for almost anything. He has put his name forward for roles including office jobs, administration, factory work - and even a position as a train driver. Mr Davies, who spends his spare time writing and has published three poetry books and is currently working on two novels, has also registered with job agencies in Cardiff and Swansea. He says he is not fussed about where he is based. 'I drive, I am willing to travel a decent distance,' he said. 'I have the will, I have the drive. I would understand if I had bad interview technique but I am not even getting calls back. 'My CV has been redone by three or four different people. 'All my friends cannot believe it. They say I must be the most unfortunate person. 'I can't think of anyone else who would leave Britain three times to find work. I even applied for a job as a train driver, just because it was there. 'I feel awful thinking I have a lot to offer but no one wants to use me. It's frustrating, upsetting. If I was very blasé it would be a whole different story.' He added: 'My job centre told me ages ago I was caught in a catch-22, saying I was over-qualified for a factory-type job but under-experienced for the kind of job I wanted to do.' Struggle: The 34-year-old will work anywhere in Britain, but despite his flexibility, he has not secured a job . Mr Davies is not the first luckless candidate to struggle finding a job. In 2011, Leanne Shipley, 18, from East Yorkshire, applied for 300 jobs without hearing back from a single one. In the same year, 19-year-old Bob Jewers, from County Durham, said he had been rejected from 400 jobs, only getting replies from four. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said employment in Wales went up in the last quarter by 24,000 people. The spokesman added: 'Unemployment fell in the last three months by 13,000 so there are just 92,000 people out of work in Wales. 'The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance in Wales has also fallen by 17,000 in the last year.'","Huw Davies has been hunting for a permanent job for almost 13 years .

21c57af18d698b8e79373c1467b2e8b98d9f3496,"The elderly husband who has been charged with the murder of two women in Victoria nearly 24 years ago - one of them being his wife - has described the accusations as 'bizarre'. Robert Penny told the Herald Sun that he was shocked when police charged him with murdering Claire Acocks and his wife Margaret Penny at Old London Coiffure Hairdressers in Portland on May 3, 1991, about 350km west of Melbourne. The 83-year-old, of Malvern East, has spoken out since he briefly appeared at Melbourne Magistrates court on Monday. Margaret Penny was murdered in a hair salon in Portland, Victoria on May 3, 1991 . Also brutally murdered at Old London Coiffure Hairdressers was Claire Acocks . Nearly 24 years after the horrific event Margaret's husband Robert Denny, 83, has been charged with two counts of murder . 'It's been hanging over my head for a year and it's not having a very good effect on me. Not knowing anything about it, really, and to be charged with a double murder - what the hell would I want to murder someone for?' Mr Penny told the Herald Sun. 'They had some new faces in the police force that were investigating and they suddenly decided it was my problem... It's just bizarre.' Mr Penny also revealed that he called his late-wife's sister, Ann Bryden, to further plead his innocence a day after facing court. 'He rang and said, ""I didn't do it, why would I kill her? We were in love"",' Ms Bryden told the Herald Sun. Ms Bryden then said that she does not believe Mr Penny killed his wife. Penny was not required to speak during the hearing on Monday that lasted less than five minutes .

Lawyer Rob Starry, who is representing Robert Penny, outside court on Monday . Unsteady on his feet in the dock, Penny was not required to speak during the hearing that lasted less than five minutes on Monday. Claire Acocks and Margaret Penny were found badly beaten, repeatedly stabbed, with their throats cut and were wrapped in black hair wraps, the Herald Sun reported. His current wife was in court on the day, and the accused was seen waving at the woman - who reportedly has concerns about her elderly husband's health. Police launched a cold case investigation into the murders in 2006, and Penny resurfaced as a suspect last year, despite being cleared of any involvement during the original investigation. He was remanded in custody to appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court for a committal mention on July 6. Penny was remanded in custody to appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court for a committal mention on July 6, and is expected to apply for bail on Monday afternoon .

Members of Ms Acocks' family, including her son Tim - who was a young constable at the time and one of the first at the murder scene - were at the hearing on Monday. 'We are grateful for the determination of the homicide squad detectives who have continued to investigate this matter to endeavour to gain a resolution for us and justice for Claire,' they later said in a statement. The family said they were 'extremely encouraged' by the developments but would not comment further while the matter is before the courts.
