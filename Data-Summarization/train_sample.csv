72561964c5b06ff31abc1346da4fd2ec64f086b8,"A woman in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland who'd fallen ill tested negative for Ebola, the Scottish government said Tuesday. A spokesman for the government said the woman had been in West Africa recently, though she had no direct contact with anyone with Ebola. ""A patient at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary has tested negative for Ebola,"" the press release said. ""The individual was transferred to the hospital by the Scottish Ambulance Service yesterday after falling ill while visiting Torridon in the Scottish Highlands."" Meanwhile, a health care worker who was diagnosed with the Ebola virus after returning to Scotland from Sierra Leone was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in London. The patient is Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow, Scotland, the hospital said. She was working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center, said Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization. She traveled via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late Sunday, the health agency NHS Scotland said. After feeling unwell, she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola within the United Kingdom. British media outlets said Cafferkey is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children. She was reportedly transferred to London in a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod. The Royal Free Hospital is equipped with a high-level isolation unit, with access restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent, with controlled ventilation, is set up over the patient's bed. A British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was successfully treated in the unit after he was brought home from Sierra Leone in August, having been diagnosed with Ebola there. 'Extremely low' risk . UK authorities are working to trace those who have come into contact with Cafferkey. The Scottish government has set up a special number for people to call if they traveled on the same London Heathrow-to-Glasgow flight as Cafferkey. British Airways said it was working closely with health authorities in England and Scotland and would help with any information needed. ""The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority and the risk to people on board that individual flight is extremely low,"" the airline said. Ebola patients become infectious only after they display symptoms, such as fever and vomiting. The deadly virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids. A Downing Street spokesman told CNN that British Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had discussed the procedures in place to handle such a case. ""They agreed that both governments would remain in close touch and ensure everything possible was done to support the patient and, although the risk to the general population remained low, all measures would be taken to protect public health."" Possible case . Another suspected Ebola case is being tested in southwest England at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, health officials said. ""We do not expect the results to be known for at least 24 hours and in the meantime the patient is being looked after in isolation, following nationally agreed guidelines and protocols to protect the health of our staff and other patients,"" said a joint statement from the hospital and Public Health England, a government agency. According to UK government guidelines, humanitarian workers returning from Ebola-affected countries in West Africa who've been at high risk of exposure are expected to monitor their own health for 21 days after they get home. As of December 24, at least 7,693 people had died in the current Ebola outbreak, centered in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the World Health Organization said. There have been at least 19,695 cases.","Woman in the Scottish Highlands tests negative for Ebola, government says .

fe1c5a0ff4f6999573dbbdd94dd0306c2ba0ea6a,"(CNN) -- Scientifically, can happiness be an advantage? Some people think if you are happy, you are blind to reality. But when we research it, happiness actually raises every single business and educational outcome for the brain. How did we miss this? Why do we have these societal misconceptions about happiness? Because we assumed you were average. When we study people, scientists are often interested in what the average is. If we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. Many people think happiness is genetic. That's only half the story, because the average person does not fight their genes. When we stop studying the average and begin researching positive outliers -- people who are above average for a positive dimension like optimism or intelligence -- a wildly different picture emerges. Our daily decisions and habits have a huge impact upon both our levels of happiness and success. Watch Shawn Achor's TED video to hear about this research . Scientifically, happiness is a choice. It is a choice about where your single processor brain will devote its finite resources as you process the world. If you scan for the negative first, your brain literally has no resources left over to see the things you are grateful for or the meaning embedded in your work. But if you scan the world for the positive, you start to reap an amazing advantage. See also: When losing your job is a positive . Now that there is research validity to these claims, the working world is starting to take notice. In January, I wrote the cover story for the Harvard Business Review magazine on ""Happiness Leads to Profits."" Based on my article called ""Positive Intelligence"" and my research in The Happiness Advantage, I outlined our researched conclusion: the single greatest advantage in the modern economy is a happy and engaged workforce. A decade of research in the business world proves that happiness raises nearly every business and educational outcome: raising sales by 37%, productivity by 31%, and accuracy on tasks by 19%, as well as a myriad of health and quality-of-life improvements. Given the unprecedented level of unhappiness at companies and the direct link between happiness and business outcomes, the question is NOT whether happiness should matter to companies. Given this research, it clearly should. The first question is: What can I do in my own life to reap the advantage of happiness? See also: Ambition could make you rich, but not happy . Training your brain to be positive at work is just like training your muscles at the gym. Sounds simple, right? Well, think about how easy it is to make yourself go to the gym. The key with any new resolution is to make it a habit. New research on neuroplasticity -- the ability of the brain to change even as an adult -- reveals that moderate actions can rewire the brain as you create ""life habits."" In The Happiness Advantage, I challenge readers to do one brief positive exercise every day for 21 days. Only through behavioral change can information become transformation. • Write down three new things you are grateful for each day; . • Write for two minutes a day describing one positive experience you had over the past 24 hours; . • Exercise for 10 minutes a day; . • Meditate for two minutes, focusing on your breath going in and out; . • Write one quick email first thing in the morning thanking or praising someone in your social support network (family member, friend, old teacher). But does it work? In the midst of the worst tax season in history I did a three-hour intervention at auditing and tax accounting firm KPMG, describing how to reap the happiness advantage by creating one of these positive habits. Four months later, there was a 24% improvement in job and life satisfaction. Not only is change possible, this is one of the first long-term ROI (return on investment) studies proving that happiness leads to long-term quantifiable positive change. In a study I performed on 1,600 Harvard students in 2007, I found that there was a 0.7 correlation between perceived social support and happiness. This is higher than the connection between smoking and cancer. So if in the modern world we give up our social networks to work away from friends and follow celebrities on Twitter, we are trading off with our happiness and health. Following up, I switched around the questions and asked how much social support employees provided (instead of received). The results were off the charts. Those high on provision of social support are 10 times more engaged at work and have a 40% higher likelihood of promotion over the next four years. In other words, giving at the office gets you more than receiving. The greatest cultural myth in modern society is that we cannot change. My research proves that you can not only become more positive, but if you prioritize happiness in the present, you can reap an extraordinary advantage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shawn Achor.","The greatest advantage in the economy is a happy workforce, argues Shawn Achor .

aa5d2622fd5b2c57e3ae0a284d3306d50bae514e,"The day England striker Daniel Sturridge gave Graham Kitchener the runaround at football made the Leicester Tigers lock realise he should stick to rugby. Towards the end of his three years at the Wolverhampton Wanderers Academy, Kitchener was given a tough time by Sturridge in a junior game against Coventry. Kitchener was 14 at the time and the experience helped him to decide that he should turn his attention to the oval ball. Leicester’s Graham Kitchener charges forward against Harlequins earlier this month . Kitchener is pushing for a Six Nations call-up after an impressive start to the season . Graham Kitchener, Rugby club: Leicester, Football club: Wolves, Football position: centre half . Jordan Crane – Leicester – Leeds United - goalkeeper . Danny Cipriani – Sale – QPR – left back . Mark Cueto – Sale – Crewe Alexandra – left wing . Marland Yarde – Harlequins – QPR – centre midfield . Danny Care –Harlequins – Sheffield Wednesday - striker . Alex Goode – Saracens – Ipswich – centre midfield . David Strettle – Saracens – Manchester City – right wing . Dom Barrow - Newcastle - Manchester United – centre half . The decision paid off and the 6ft 6in and 19st forward is currently knocking on the door for a Six Nations call-up. However, there was a time when he seemed more likely to pursue a career as a centre half, rather than a second-row. ‘I flirted with football for a couple of years,’ said Kitchener. ‘At Wolves, we went on tour and played against teams like Arsenal and Manchester United. ‘I played against Sturridge when I was 14. I was marking him — or trying to! As you’d expect, he wasn’t a bad player and was a pretty big unit back in the day. 'He gave a few of us the runaround, but at the time you didn’t really appreciate what he would go on to achieve.’ Sturridge now earns around £150,000 a week, while salaries in rugby are a relative drop in the ocean. But Kitchener recognised the slim chances involved with pursuing football’s mega-bucks and instead completed his A-levels and signed for Worcester Warriors. Daniel Sturridge gave Kitchener the runaround during an academy game between Wolves and Coventry . Out of his academy age-group at Wolves, only Elliott Bennett went on to play in the Premier League as most failed to make the cut in an extremely competitive market. But doors to the senior ranks opened quickly when Kitchener turned his focus to rugby. ‘I realised I was a bit more suited to the rugby environment with my size and that kind of thing,’ said Kitchener. ‘There were a few transferable skills — we focused a lot on agility and speed over a short distance, which always helps. Kitchener has no regrets turning his back on football to pursue a career in rugby . ‘We would train about three times a week at Wolves — it was tough, but not a lot of people made it so I didn’t see a massive future in the game.’ Kitchener is not the only ex-footballer to make the switch. As with a hard-hitting forward, natural size and strength is a valuable asset for a goalkeeper or defender. Jordan Crane and Joe Launchbury are both former keepers who went on to play in the pack, while Dom Barrow and Kitchener were centre halves who joined rugby’s heavies in the tight-five. Physicality is not such an important asset in the back-line and some of England Rugby’s most skilful playmakers have backgrounds as wing backs, midfielders and strikers. Saracens full back Alex Goode is one of the most intelligent readers of the game — previously he conducted play as a central midfielder for Ipswich Town. Harlequins star Danny Care used to play as a strike for Sheffield Wednesday before switching to rugby . Harlequins scrum-half Danny Care is known for his ability to snipe around the fringes of the breakdown and he used to run lines through the defence as a nippy striker for Sheffield Wednesday. Similarly, Danny Cipriani, Marland Yarde, David Strettle and Mark Cueto all played further up the field in football before becoming astute backs in rugby. At Welford Road, Kitchener is often seen breaking clear of defenders, in a way you would not expect from a man of his size. His footwork and quick change of balance helps keep defenders guessing and his form has earned him a consistent run in Leicester’s starting XV. Director of rugby Richard Cockerill has rotated his squad for tonight’s Champions Cup tie against Scarlets, with Kitchener on the bench alongside England hooker Tom Youngs and Wales hopeful Owen Williams. Kitchener is aiming high and has targeted a first cap for England . But Kitchener has international ambitions. After playing for the Saxons and being called up as injury cover for the November Tests, he is now hoping to go one better and win his first cap. ‘I loved being involved in the autumn and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t thinking about it,’ said Kitchener. ‘The reality is there are a lot of quality second-rows around England at the moment, so I just have to see how it goes.’","Graham Kitchener played against footballer Daniel Sturridge at youth level .

33ace7d4debafb7ce44f4ca390f9f16fa9c79e95,"Mexico's leader proposed a series of reforms Thursday that he hopes will help combat widespread crime and corruption. President Enrique Peña Nieto has come under fire for what some saw as his slow reaction to the disappearance of 43 college students, and for traveling abroad as protests spread across the country. In September, a group of students boarded buses and vans bound for the nearby city of Iguala, intending to protest about a lack of funding for their school. They have not been heard from since. ""After Iguala, Mexico must change,"" Peña Nieto told a group of politicians and lawmakers. He proposed more than a dozen reforms, including a constitutional change that would give the state control over local police. The plan would be worked out in stages, starting with the states of Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán and Tamaulipas, he said. The President also proposed setting up a nationwide emergency number, like 911 in the United States, and said he wants to boost development by creating three special economic zones in the country's impoverished south. Bodies found in southwestern Mexico . Peña Nieto spoke the same day authorities announced that 11 partially burned bodies of young adults have been found in southwestern Mexico, just an hour's drive from where 43 missing college students went to school. Police haven't publicly identified the remains, and officials have not said whether there is any connection between the bodies and the September disappearances of the 43 students -- a case that has led to unrest over allegations that police abducted them, on order of a mayor, and turned them over to a gang that killed them. The 11 bodies were discovered near Chilapa, about an hour's drive west of Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, a small college devoted to training students to become teachers in Mexico's impoverished countryside. Some of the 11 bodies were decapitated, according to Guerrero state officials. Search for students continues . Authorities say the 43 students intended to protest a speech by the wife of Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca. Prosecutors allege that Abarca ordered police to round up the students. Authorities say they believe the students were captured by Iguala police, turned over to a gang, and then executed in Cocula, 14 miles away. The gang burned the bodies and dumped them in a river, authorities say, but investigators have yet to link any remains to the missing students. Mexican prosecutors have called Abarca the ""probable mastermind"" in the disappearances, charging him with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide, authorities said. In all, at least 75 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearances. Earlier this month, authorities investigating the case said human remains were found in at least one garbage bag in the San Juan River. Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said DNA tests were needed to identify the remains; no results have been announced. The Iguala incident sparked protests across Mexico, some of them violent. The governor of Guerrero state, who was criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions, has taken a leave of absence.","President Enrique Peña Nieto proposes giving the state control over local police .

7d078b7a0179f06ded09d4cb1c5076fc72ec4bc9,"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 6:10 PM on 4th October 2011 . David Cameron promised a 'better time ahead' as he acknowledged today that families are suffering difficult times due to the uncertain economic situation. The Prime Minister said the Government is taking action where it can to help keep families' bills down, citing Chancellor George Osborne's announcement yesterday of a one-year council tax freeze. But he insisted that he would stick to the deficit reduction package of cuts and tax rises. Scroll down for video . David Cameron left the conference hotel with MP Nicky Morgan this morning to give interviews in which he said he understood the financial difficulties faced by families . Speaking at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, the Prime Minister also warned that interest rates would . rise if the international money markets lost confidence that Britain . was paying off its debts. 'The whole message of this conference is that we know things are difficult, we know families face difficult times right now, but we have got to show the leadership to make the right decisions and get us through this difficult time and get to a better time ahead,' he told ITV1's Daybreak. 'I completely understand that families today do see the prices at the petrol pump high, food prices have gone up. Many people, particularly in the public sector, have had their pay frozen. 'I understand the difficulty people are going through, so the council tax freeze is helpful because that is one bill that is not going up. Finishing touches: David Cameron, William Hague and aid Kate Fall go through the Prime Minister's keynote speech, which will be delivered tomorrow . 'All the time, we are looking to see is there spare money we can use to help Britain's families get through what is a difficult time.' Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'People are very worried about future job prospects, and this Government has got to do everything we can to reassure them that the difficult decisions we are taking, and I believe they are necessary, are in the long-term interest of the country.' The PM insisted it was 'completely unfair' to say the Tories were supporting the rich. 'Overall . the richest 10 per cent are going to pay 10 times more tax than the . poorest. I think this is a fair way to reduce the deficit.' Calling for responsibility at the top of society, Mr Cameron backed Mr Osborne's plan to tackle tax avoidance. The Prime Minister repeated his Chancellor's vow that the Tories would not be moved from its deficit reduction plan . 'I want responsibility from people at the top as well as at the bottom and paying your taxes is a key responsibility.' Mr . Cameron rejected the idea that the government had found more than £1billion for extra spending commitments 'down the back of the sofa'. And . he defended using the money to fund weekly bin collections and a . council tax freeze rather than cutting the deficit more quickly. Eric Pickles (pictured) came in for praise from Cameron for his plan to freeze council tax . 'When a government is spending around £700billion a year it is perfectly possible, through good financial management, to find savings and underspends and use that money wisely,' he said. 'With bin collections, I think a lot of families in this country would say ""Look, the one service I get from my district council is the bin collection and I really would like them to collect the smelly food waste once a week"". 'I think that is a thing you should expect in a civilised country. 'I think that is a good use of money by (Communities Secretary) Eric Pickles, I think the use of money to freeze council tax is a good use of money.' Mr Cameron said it was possible to take action on 'people's priorities' because the Government had been 'very tough on its own costs'. Mr Cameron said he did not believe the Government should intervene to stop bonuses or put a cap on pay in the banking sector. He told the Today programme: 'On the question of bonuses, if there is a bank entirely in the private sector, I want to see responsible behaviour and I want to see us regulating properly, but we can't determine the pay structure in every single organisation. That wouldn't be the right thing to do. 'Companies do need to attract and retain and recruit good staff. I am not opposed to the idea of bonuses. I used to work in business, I used to employ staff and negotiate bonuses with people. 'A bonus on top of what you earn to reward hard work and good behaviour is part of what happens in corporate life and that's entirely right.' Mr Cameron said Labour leader Ed Miliband had gone 'off the rails' in his conference in Liverpool last week when he proposed using tax and regulation to support good business practices and penalise bad ones. 'Where I think Ed goes off the rails is the idea that the Chancellor of the Exchequer can sit there and say there is one tax rate for this company and another tax rate for that company. Mr Cameron said that Ed Miliband had gone 'off the rails' at the Labour Party conference when he proposed using tax and regulation to support good business practices and penalise bad ones . 'It is completely impractical and that is why the business response to the Labour conference was so negative, because they thought 'Heavens above, we are trying to grow an economy and get more people working and we need investment and jobs. What on earth is this guy talking about?'' Mr Cameron challenged Mr Miliband's claim that Labour was opposed to the culture of 'something for nothing' in British society. 'I have been saying for five years that if you put into society you should get out of society,' he said. 'If you do the right thing, bring up your children, work hard and try to take a role in your community, you should be able to look back on a life and say 'I did the right thing and it was worth it'. 'The tragedy in our country today is too many people who do the right thing think it's not worth it because actually they get punished for that good behaviour, rather than rewarded. 'What I found rather staggering about the Labour conference is that they don't seem to understand that the massive budget deficit they built up was a something-for-nothing deficit. 'The fact that they haven't tackled all these people on welfare who for years have been able to stay on welfare even though they could work - that was a something-for-nothing culture. 'The words are great, but what matters in government is are you doing the things to back them up.' Mr Cameron insisted that the Government was following its mantra that 'we are all in this together' in paying down the deficit. 'I don't accept this is a Government that has one rule at the top and one rule at the bottom,' he said. 'We are absolutely asking people at the top of our society to be responsible and we are completely dissatisfied about the way the banking industry behaved over the last decade.'","Prime Minister warns that interest rates would rise if markets lost confidence in Britain .

89ef6046a1ced5ee4a4fa556ed5fad1f666882b9,"A millionaire hotel owner attacked his estranged wife's new lover with his nine-year-old son's cricket bat after discovering the pair of them had starting sleeping together, a court heard. Nigel Underwood, 45, previously ran the  Grade-II listed Oaklands Hall Hotel in Laceby, Lincolnshire, with wife Sarah, 45. But a court heard in July this year the businessman took his wife to rehab to treat an addiction to alcohol. Sarah Underwood's affair prompted her husband (centre) to attack her lover Andrew Wordsworth (right) with a their 9-year-old son's cricket bat. There Sarah struck up a relationship with another recovering addict Andrew Wordsworth, 47, at the rehabilitation centre in Barnsley, South Yorks. Lincoln Crown Court heard on September 11 that Sarah returned to a caravan where she had been staying following her treatment with her new lover. Underwood was waiting for them at the site in Chapel St Leonards, Lincolnshire, and produced the wooden bat from his car after spotting his love rival. He then launched at Mr Wordsworth and battered him the weapon causing injuries to his left arm and head. On Tuesday Underwood - who also runs the Savoy Hotel and Suncastle Entertainment Complex in Skegness, Lincolnshire - admitted assault and possession of an offensive weapon. He walked free from court after being given a 12-month community order with supervision. Jilted husband Nigel Underwood said he wants to make amends with his estranged wife Sarah . Sarah and Nigel are co-owners of plush Oaklands Hall Hotel in Laceby, Lincolnshire . The entrepreneur was also ordered to pay £250 compensation to Mr Wordsworth, £250 prosecution costs as well as a £60 victim surcharge. Underwood defended his actions, saying: 'He took my wife off me - I just did what any man would have done.' The court heard the incident happened after Sarah had collected her new lover following his discharge from the rehab centre. Andrew Scott, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Wordsworth was a recovering alcoholic. Mrs Underwood was also a recovering alcoholic. 'They met at a treatment centre in Barnsley. 'They started up a relationship and when Mrs Underwood was discharged she said she wanted a separation. 'She moved to a caravan in Chapel St Leonards. The defendant did not take the news very well. 'Mr Wordsworth was struck a glancing blow to the head but managed to protect himself with his arm.' Underwood later went to Skegness Police Station where he handed himself in and confessed to what he had done. Nigel Underwood said he did the 'honourable' thing by handing himself in after the attack . Mr Scott added: 'The defendant described his actions as stupid. In interview he said that when his wife came out of rehab she was a different person. 'She said she needed space. 'She was still coming back to their home. 'When she didn't come back that night he went to see where she was.' Sentencing Underwood, from Skegness, Recorder Ciaran Rankin told him: 'You are an intelligent and successful businessman employing many people. 'It is clear that this happened at an emotionally charged time in your life.' 'Honest, upstanding man': Nigel Underwood said he had strong community support after the attack . Sunil Khanna, defending, said Underwood had no previous convictions and was embarrassed by what he had done. He added: 'He is a very sensible and honest, upstanding man.' Speaking after the case Underwood, who has three children with wife Sarah, said he still loved his wife and would take her back. He added: 'I just want my wife back. We have three children together and I just want her to be better. 'Instead, she is shacked up with a recovering alcoholic. I just did what any man would do. I acted honourably as I could and handed myself in straight away. 'That was the night I found they had started a physical relationship and I wasn't happy about it. 'When I saw him I just had to clock him one. 'He was with my wife, who I have stood by for 15 years while she has battled alcoholism. 'On the night she said she had been worried and I wanted to see she was OK and hadn't hit the Barcadi again. 'I had the cricket bat because it was my son's and I help run the borough district cricket team. He came towards me so I reacted and walloped him. 'I was looking out for her because I still love to bits. 'Everybody has stood by me, I had members of my family and members of the Skegness Round Table, where I am chairman, present at court to support me. 'But I have lost a wife, my children have lost their mother, it is a sorry state of affairs but we all love and care for her still.'","Nigel Underwood, 45, took wife Sarah, 45, to rehab to treat alcohol addiction .

48dfd071bcdc2acd53abda3d272b1160f08bedb7,"The omission of Joan Rivers from the In Memoriam segment of Sunday night’s Oscars caused uproar among fans on social media within moments of the segment being aired. Although Joan wasn’t an Oscar-winning actress or filmmaker, she was unquestionably an influential woman in Academy Awards history. The 81-year-old actress, comedian, and TV host died suddenly on September 4 from complications during surgery. Scroll down for video . Snub: Comedian and TV host Joan Rivers was left out of the 2015 Academy Awards In Memoriam segment . Joan Rivers' acting roles included voicing the gold robot Dot Matrix in 1987's Spaceballs, while Elaine Stritch, right, was another showbiz legend missing from the In Memoriam segment . The next say the Academy responded. 'Joan Rivers is among the many worthy artists and filmmakers we were unfortunately unable to feature in the In Memoriam segment of this year’s Oscar show,' a rep for the Academy told The Hollywood Reporter. 'She is, however, included in our In Memoriam gallery on Oscar.com.' According to a Monday post from TMZ, daughter Melissa isn't too happy. 'She feels her mom deserved a place in the In Memoriam portion of the Oscars, but she's not going to focus on the snub,' a source told the site. While Joan's movie career wasn't of the type usually honoured by the Oscars - she tended to show up mostly in comedic cameos in movies including The Muppets Take Manhattan, Spaceballs, and The Smurfs - her mark on the ceremony itself was huge. Joan began hosting the E! network's pre-Academy Awards red carpet with daughter Melissa Rivers in 1995, a job she continued through 2014. Other snubs included Taylor Negron, left in The Last Boy Scout, and SNL alum Jan Hooks, right as Hillary Clinton . According to Vanity Fair, the Rivers women 'revolutionized the red carpet - from a runway with little celebrity-reporter interaction - into its own brand of entertainment.' She also wrote and directed 1978's Rabbit Test, while Maya Angelou was included despite only directing one film (1998's Down in the Delta). Joan's omission from the tribute section of the Academy Awards immediately stirred up a passionate reaction on Twitter. 'No Joan Rivers? Tacky to say the least,' tweeted Ryan Parker. Tacky: Fans quickly took to Twitter to protest the 'tacky' omission of Joan . Colleagues: Sally Jessy Raphael, a TV-host colleague of Joan's, tweeted quickly in indignation . Anger: Some Twitter users grew angry about the snub . Jokes: In Joan's style, some protested with the use of humour . Missing: From the beginning of the show, some missed Joan's signature style on the red carpet . Talk-show host Sally Jessy Raphael chimed in as well: 'No mention of @Joan_Rivers in the Memorial?! That's not right.' '#Oscars feels wrong w/out #JoanRivers. Bummed the Academy didn't include the red carpet queen during the In Memoriam,' wrote Matt Whitfield. Some fans on social media at least found a little dark comedy in the situation. 'Joan Rivers is gonna surprise us after the commercial break by being alive, I guess,' wrote Shalyah Evans. Complaints about In Memoriam snubs have been around just about as long as the segment itself and Joan wasn’t the only surprising snub in the 2015 version. Introduction: Frequent Oscar nominee Meryl Streep introduced the always sad segment . Tributes: While Joan was left out, film-making luminaries like Robin Williams, Malik Bendjelloul, Ruby Dee, and more were mentioned . Broadway legend and comedienne Elaine Stritch had appeared in films including A Farewell To Arms and Monster-In-Law. Taylor Negron had been a character actor of some note with memorable roles in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Last Boy Scout. Another missing name was Jan Hooks, an SNL alum who appeared in Batman Returns, Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Coneheads. Others on social media complained that writer-director-actor Harold Ramis had also been left out, but the Ghostbusters - who star passed away in early 2014 – had been included in last year's Oscars ceremony. Those who were mentioned in the tribute, introduced by Meryl Streep, included Robin Williams, Mike Nichols, Mickey Rooney, Lauren Bacall, James Garner, Ruby Dee, Luise Rainer and Maya Angelou. After the photo tributes finished, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson sang. Music: After the memorial pictures were shown, Jennifer Hudson performed .","Comedian Rivers was a surprising omission from Sunday night's tribute to those no longer with us .
Joan was better known more for her caustic critiques of those walking the red carpet, but she had also appeared in and even directed a movie .

A seven-year-old girl from New York City, who was stabbed repeatedly in an elevator of her apartment building, is slowly recovering at home. Mikayla Capers was stabbed 16 times and her best friend, six-year-old PJ Avitto was killed, during an attack in the Brooklyn building where they both lived last month. A 27-year-old, who had recently been released from prison, has been charged with the attack. Recovering: Mikayla Capers, left, is traumatized after being stabbed in an elevator during an attack that claimed the life of her best friend PJ Avitto, right, as the pair went out for ice cream . Heartbroken: A bouquet is placed on a hearse carrying young PJ Avitto's body. His family and friends, including Mikayla, are still trying to come to terms with his death . Daniel St. Hubert, was charged with the murder of PJ and the attack on Mikayla, on June 5, the day before hundreds of people gathered for the funeral of the little boy. The young friends had been heading out of their building to buy ice creams on June 1 when they were attacked. PJ's body was found inside the elevator, and Mikayla was found barely conscious outside a nearby building. She is slowly recovering from the physical injuries she suffered in the attack, and her family said she is being helped with the emotional trauma by a teddy bear that sings 'smile though your heart is aching'. St Hubert, who is accused of carrying out the attack, had only just been released from prison, where he had served a five-year sentence for attempted murder and assault. Suspect: Daniel St Hubert, who had recently been released from prison on an attempted murder charge, was arrested in connection with the attack . Court records show he was arrested in May 2009 after punching his mother in the face, choking her with an electrical cord and stealing her car. He pleaded guilty in July 2012. Police said St Hubert was a suspect in the stabbing of a homeless man on a Manhattan subway platform and the fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Tanaya Copeland, just a few blocks from the Brooklyn elevator attack. He is not charged in those crimes. Investigators are now reviewing all stabbings citywide that have occurred since St Hubert was freed on May 23. If convicted, St Hubert faces a maximum 50 years to life in prison.","Mikayla Capers was stabbed 16 times as she went out for ice cream .

ded442323118f357e558fb44368fbdb1016657f2,"(CNN) -- After moving from New York to Virginia Beach five years ago, Jennifer Herzog started noticing something odd when exiting grocery stores. Her hands and forearms felt hot, looked red and were swollen. After a few errands, she identified the irritant: plastic bags. ""There are some plastic bags that do it, and there are some that don't,"" Herzog said. ""All grocery bags pretty much are bad."" She started noticing other irritants, too: She began to have a similar response to fragrances as she had to plastic bags. Now, when she hugs someone wearing certain perfumes or colognes, her face turns red and swells. Dermatologist Joseph Fowler says skin reactions to fragrances and perfumes are common, but to have a reaction from finished plastic products like plastic bags is extremely rare, though not undocumented. ""There are a bunch of chemicals in plastics that can cause an allergy, usually when they're in the raw material state, and the unfinished products,"" said Fowler, co-author of a medical textbook on dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin. ""But because the chemicals in finished products are bound so tightly, it's awfully hard for them to penetrate to the skin and set off the allergy."" Then again, the finished products may not be the real problem. A reaction to plastics like Herzog's may have more to do with residue from the manufacturing process than the plastic itself, says materials science expert Andrew Dent. ""There are additives to make the plastic bags easier to process that manufacturers are putting on the outside surfaces,"" said Dent, vice president of materials research at Material ConneXion. ""That could also be the problem."" Others may react with redness and swelling to plastic bags, but they don't necessarily have an allergy. A condition called dermographic urticaria, in which the skin becomes inflamed from scratching or rubbing, is far more common, Fowler explains. For those with the condition, carrying heavy bags from the grocery store could be enough to cause a reaction. Herzog, however, has developed allergies to some chemicals in plastics and perfumes, her doctor tells her, as well as to seasonal allergens like pollen. Her doctor explained that allergies to just about anything can develop at any time. ""I don't understand how it just comes out of nowhere, because I never, never had issues,"" Herzog said. She wonders whether things could just as suddenly get even worse for her or for people she knows. It's a notion she's confronted with not just in her personal life but also at work, in the catered food she arranges for groups of children and preteens at big events. Despite being 28 years old, Herzog has worked in the food and beverage industry long enough to see a dramatic increase in the number of children with food sensitivities, she says. She wonders whether people are generally becoming more sensitive to things. ""It's amazing how many allergies these kids have. It's insane. We're preparing more special meals than regular meals. Which is weird, because then when you do adult functions, you maybe have like one or two allergies. The chefs are becoming very well-versed in this now."" Herzog's observations have some backing in peer-reviewed medical studies. The latest numbers -- now two years old -- draw from 40,000 children in the U.S. and reveal that 8% of those under the age of 18 have food allergies. That's twice the number estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using data collected in 2007. Dr. Ruchi Gupta, who led the study finding the 8% figure, says that's probably a conservative number, in part because her team discounted reports by parents when the symptoms sounded more like a food intolerance, such as to gluten or lactose, than a true food allergy. Although Gupta and the CDC used parent surveys to make their estimates, hospital records show a similar upward trend. U.S. hospitals discharged about 4,135 children with diagnosed food allergies each year between 2001 and 2003. For the period from 2004 to 2006, that average annual number jumped to 9,537, according to the CDC. ""Food allergy among children in the United States is becoming more common over time,"" states the CDC website. Whether food intolerance to lactose and gluten is also increasing is harder to determine, in part because the conditions often go undiagnosed. As the medical community grapples to understand the problem and what can be done about it, businesses have had to adapt and accommodate. ""It's a matter of life and death, especially with children. Six or seven years ago, you'd just say, 'Sorry, that risk is too much to take. I (would) suggest they bring something with them, or they don't come,' "" said Jennifer Delaye, president of the International Caterers Association. ""Now, today, it's a standard way of doing business. Entire menus are designed around that.""","""There are a bunch of chemicals in plastics that can cause an allergy,"" Dr. Joseph Fowler says .

750af28fcbd7f4a886cef58becec7c230a69b82e,"(CNN) -- It's hard to imagine Meryl Streep having second thoughts about tackling any role, but the actress admits that she had doubts about ""Doubt,"" her newest project. The cast of ""Doubt,"" from left: Viola Davis, Amy Adams, Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film -- based on a Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning play by the same name -- examines what happens when a strict nun who heads a Catholic school in the Bronx suspects a charismatic priest of having an inappropriate relationship with a student. ""I actually didn't think it would ever be a movie,"" Streep said. ""It was so thoroughly realized on stage, and it was so minimal. It was hard to imagine how or why you would make a movie out of it."" But Streep, who plays the terrifyingly severe and determined school principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier, said she changed her mind when she saw the final product. ""How did they make the play without any children in it? It is just sort of amazing to me, because to me they are sort of the landscape. They are the lambs of the movie. They are the stakes. They are why everybody is passionate."" Her co-stars are passionate about sharing the screen with a Hollywood legend. Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays the priest targeted by Streep's character in the film, says he ""adores"" her. Amy Adams calls Streep ""a sweetheart."" Viola Davis says she's ""just fantastic."" Davis' performance in the movie is generating Oscar buzz, with Streep advising the actress to pick out a dress for the Academy Awards. Davis, who plays the mother of the student at the center of the sexual abuse allegations at the school, said she drew on the experiences of her mom and other women she knows to bring the role to life. She expressed awe about any suggestion of an Oscar nomination. ""It's surreal. I don't know how to respond to that anymore,"" Davis said. ""All I wanted to do was good work. ... Everything else is just the icing on the cake."" The movie is set in 1964, but the play was written by John Patrick Shanley after the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the Roman Catholic Church several years ago. Hoffman -- who plays Father Flynn, the priest under fire -- said the lurid headlines about molested children weren't even on his mind when he took on the project. ""It is really about something else. If people see it, they will know what I mean about that,"" Hoffman said. Some have suggested that the play served as a criticism of the Bush administration's dogged belief that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Shanley, who won an Academy Award for his screenplay of ""Moonstruck,"" told Entertainment Weekly that the play did have a political point. ""I'm not interested in morality,"" he told the magazine. ""One of my larger premises in doing this play, in what's not said, is that doubt itself is a passionate exercise. I think it's perceived in this culture as something weak or denatured, and that's a huge mistake."" Adams said she became ""a little obsessed"" with the adaptation of the play to the big screen. She plays Sister James, a nun who expresses her suspicions about Father Flynn's relationship with the student to Sister Aloysius. The movie is a departure for Adams, who became famous for sunnier roles in films like ""Enchanted"" and ""Talladega Nights."" But she said she doesn't mind being known as an eternally cheerful actress, because that description reflects ""75 percent"" of her real persona. ""There's 25 percent that's probably dark and grumpy and not personable at all, but I keep her at home,"" Adams said. As for Oscar buzz surrounding her performance, the actress said she's keeping her fingers crossed for Streep and Davis to be nominated for their roles in ""Doubt"" but has no expectations for herself. ""It's always fun ,and I would love to. If it doesn't happen for me, it's all right as well,"" Adams said. ""So, the experience of making the film was my get in this case.""","""Doubt"" stars Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Viola Davis .
