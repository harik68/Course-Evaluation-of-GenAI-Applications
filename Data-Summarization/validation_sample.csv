02a76a7c48a7e8b5c82ea2e54913eb0b0e14b4f3,"Richard Kilty tiptoes to the front door of his old home, careful not to muddy his new trainers. It is semi-derelict and the windows are boarded up, soon to be demolished as this notoriously tough Stockton-on-Tees council estate is redeveloped. A man repairing a garage roof warns our photographer to conceal his camera but there is barely a soul about. 'It still gets eventful on the evenings,' says Kilty, pointing out a black gate blocking an alleyway entrance, installed at the behest of police officers tired of suspects they were chasing disappearing into nooks and crannies. Sprinter Richard Kilty poses on the deprived estate where he grew up in Stockton-on-Tees . Kilty waves on the podium after receiving his 60m gold medal at the European Indoor Championships . The 25-year-old, who briefly retired from athletics in 2012, works out at Deny's Gym in Stockton-on-Tees . Kilty no longer lives on the estate after experiencing success on the world stage over the last 18 months . Age: 25 . From: Stockton-on-Tees . Events: 60m, 100m, 200m . Golds: 60m - 2014 World Indoor Championships, 4x100m relay - 2014 Europeans, 60m - 2015 European Indoor Championships . Nickname: Teesside Tornado . 'It was usually just kids' stuff,' he says, but delve a little deeper and you realise how remarkable his rise has been from the deprivation of the Victoria estate to one of Britain's fastest men. A block of flats on the edge of the estate was a 'no-go zone' says Kilty, recalling mother Melanie asking him to rescue his younger brother Jack. 'I found him in a room with about 30 heroin addicts. They weren't physically intimidating, they only weighed about six stone but you didn't know if one of them was going to pull a knife on you.' In the moments before the 60metres final at the European Indoor Championships in Prague last month, Kilty glanced around the call room at his competition and his mind flickered back to life on the estate. 'I recognised the look of fear in their eyes, I've seen people in much more dangerous situations on the estate and they looked less scared than some of these athletes. 'On the evenings after I'd got home from school there'd always be fights. People would get stabbed or hit with hammers. We'd hang around in little gangs, that was just something you had to be part of. Kilty gets away from Pascal Mancini (left) and Christian Blum to win gold in Prague earlier this month . Kilty poses outside his local gym in Stockton-on-Tees after returning to the area where he grew up . Kilty shows off his 60m gold medal at the World Indoor Championships in Poland in March last year . 'All of us have gone down different paths, my friend David drowned in a river, another friend just got out of prison for aggravated burglary with a gun. I've managed to run my way out of poverty so why should I be scared standing on a start line for a race?' A year to the day after winning the World Indoor Championships in Poland Kilty, 25, won his second international title. The circumstances were very different. He was favourite, whereas 12 months earlier bookmakers had made him a 33-1 outsider with Jamaican Nesta Carter in the field. Six-and-a-half seconds and 33 strides later his life had changed. 'I went there with £17 in my bank account and by the time the plane landed back in the UK I had six figures — £40,000 from winning the race, a British Athletics bonus and a four-year contract with Nike. 'I can remember sometimes not having much money for food and clothes. When I eventually do have kids I want them to live a comfortable life not like I did. I feel I'm doing a good job of that, a couple more years like this and I'll be OK.' He knows all too well what it's like to have it all snatched away. 'I've been homeless twice,' he says. 'The first time I was five and a half and we were put in a hostel up the road, six of us sharing a room in the same building with prostitutes, asylum-seekers and drug addicts. Looking back it was crazy and dangerous but it just seemed like a bit of an adventure at the time. Kilty was made homeless twice and lived in a hostel with prostitutes, asylum seekers and drug addicts . Kilty poses with Adam Gemili, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and James Ellington (L-R) after winning the 4x100m final at the European Championships in Zurich last year . Kilty holds his head as he discusses his childhood and rise to becoming one of Britain's fastest men . 'We moved to the estate after that, my parents owned a pub and made good money for a time but my mum was an alcoholic and addicted to amphetamines. Somehow they lost all their money and we ended up with nothing. 'When I was 14 we were back in the hostel and I had come to my senses. I realised how dangerous it was, luckily my dad was strong and could protect us. I was living there when I won the English Schools title.' Kilty represented Great Britain through the junior age groups but struggled to make the leap to the senior team. Linford Christie took him under his wing before London 2012 but Kilty missed out on selection for the London Olympics despite achieving the qualifying standard for the 200m. 'I had no option but to return home to live with my mam on the estate,' he says. 'One night someone was hit with a baseball bat and nearly killed. I got arrested and was later cleared, I was 150m away when it happened but the damage had been done, my face was plastered all over the news-papers. The week after I was arrested for an alleged kidnap which again was nothing to do with me and I was cleared. But I should never have been in that environment. 'I retired from athletics and was about to join the Marines but one day I was walking by the river and I suddenly decided I couldn't let my talent go to waste. I didn't want to become a failed product of the estate so I decided to give it one last roll of the dice.' Kilty celebrates after surprising the field - and the bookmakers - to win gold in Poland in March last year . Kilt beats Christian Blum (right) to the line to win the 60m European Indoor title earlier this month . Kilty believes his success on track has helped bring his family closer together after problems in the past . Kilty's five-year-old niece, Olivia, hair tied neatly in bunches, arrives to watch her uncle have his picture taken. She is the daughter of his half-sister and still lives on the estate. They are a close family now but it was not always the case. His father Kevin, who has 12 children, was granted full custody of Kilty and his three full siblings after social services became involved. 'One side of the family was at war with the other,' he says. 'It was dysfunctional growing up but everything is good and happy at the moment. I think my success has brought the family together.' Kilty is being coached by Christie again as his focus has switched to making the British team for August's World Championships in Beijing. Vehemently anti-drugs, Kilty believes his coach's protestations that his positive drugs test for nandrolone in 1999 was erroneous. 'He'd been retired three years at that point,' he says, 'I don't believe he took drugs. I'm a clean athlete and I wouldn't train with him if I believed he was a drug abuser. 'But there definitely is a doping crisis at the moment. Justin Gatlin (current 100m world leader) is running faster at 34 — supposedly off drugs — than he was on drugs.' 'I line up against a drugs cheat in virtually every race — Gatlin, Tyson Gay, Dwain Chambers, Asafa Powell. It's annoying knowing convicted dopers are out there when you've worked so hard to get where you are.'","Richard Kilty won  60m gold at the European Indoor Championships .

And one for one of the animals taking a long swig from a beer bottle was just what they needed to refresh themselves. The herd of camels were on a trek across the Erg Chebbi dunes in Morocco, where one of the group was snapped having a refreshing drink. A camel takes a swig from a beer bottle on a short refreshment stop while trekking across the Sahara desert . Tour guides filled the beer bottles with water for the camels to drink as temperatures reached as high as 40 degrees . But rather than swigging down beer the bottles had actually been filled with water by the guides for the camels to drink. Photographer Joao Victor Bolan, who captured the image, said: 'The picture where a camel drinks from a bottle, it was obviously just for fun. It was just water. 'They don't usually drink too often and while we were there, I hadn't seen any camel drinking. 'We only made a short stop - I would say not more than 15 minutes - but judging by how fast they drank it, I guess they were thirsty.' Mr Bolan travelled over 370 miles across the High Atlas mountain range from the Moroccan city of Marrakech to reach the sand dunes. The pictures were snapped by photographer Joao Bolan, who spent time trekking across the Erg Chebbi dunes in Morocco . The 26-year-old travelled with a guide and a friend and when they reached the dunes, they hired a total of six camels to help them explore the area. And while there, they experienced extreme temperatures ranging from soaring heat during the day to freezing temperatures around minus five late at night. Mr Bolan, from Sao Paulo, Brazil added: 'I was photographing the route from Marrakech to Erg Chebbi through the High Atlas region. The group experienced extreme temperatures on their trek ranging from soaring hear during the day to freezing temperatures at night . 'We stopped at a base camp for the dunes where we spent the night. 'Like any other desert, it was incredibly hot during the day and cold at night. 'Riding the camels was a little uncomfortable to be honest. 'After two hours, your back really starts to hurt but I would say that was a nice experience because it's a huge animal that goes on a paced rhythm in a majestic environment.'","A herd of camels was trekking through the Sahara with a group of tourists .

3911b9b5aef57787d8d020d4e3d68b3bc4bafad4,"An archive of highly-classified test reports has come to light revealing how the Nazis killed thousands of German citizens by bombing their own cities with V-2 rockets - for target practice. The top-secret SS documents, much of which are written in coded German, are said to offer proof Adolf Hitler used his own towns and cities to test the scale of the devastation caused by the ballistic missiles. The incredible 20-page archive  is made up of reports which were only issued to 'Kommandostelle S', a unit so secret that hardly anything is known about it. An archive of highly-classified test reports has come to light revealing how the Nazis killed thousands of German citizens by bombing their own cities with V-2 rockets - for target practice . The top-secret SS documents, much of which are written in coded German, are said to offer proof Adolf Hitler used his own towns and cities to test the scale of the devastation caused by the ballistic missiles . The burn marks are said to be proof of the documents' sensitivity, as someone clearly tried to torch them . The incredible archive is made up of reports which were only issued to 'Kommandostelle S', a unit so secret that hardly anything is known about it . Deadly: A V-2 rocket launched in Germany from a fixed site in the summer of 1943 . They show how the desperate Nazis used their own settlements as targets while developing the deadly weapons during World War Two. It means thousands of Germans died at the hands of their own leader in 1944 and 1945 - who then blamed the carnage on Allied Forces. The V-2 rockets - the V standing for Vergeltungswaffe, or Vengeance Weapon - were fired at London and the south east of England, as well as targets on mainland Europe, killing over 7,000 people. The warheads were launched in the final months of the war as Britain advanced closer to victory and were considered Hitler's last role of the dice. However, it is widely agreed that if the Nazis has developed the rockets sooner they may have won the race to develop the atomic bomb and gone on to win the war. The V-2 rockets - the V standing for Vergeltungswaffe, or Vengeance Weapon - were fired at London and the south east of England, as well as targets on mainland Europe, killing over 7,000 people . The documents show that Hitler fired V-2 rockets from a test centre in what was then Pomerania into surrounding cities, killing his own people . Royal Air Force reconnaissance photograph of V-2 rockets at a test stand . The remarkable archive was rescued from the flames at the end of the conflict and has remained in the possession of a German collector ever since. Now it is set to go under the hammer at Chiswick Auctions, in London, on March 18, where it is expected to fetch £2,500. On Wednesday, Chiswick Auctions spokesman Richard Westwood-Brookes said: 'The V-2 was the first truly ballistic missile which might have brought victory to Hitler had he won the race to develop the atomic bomb in 1945. 'A note which comes with the archive from a researcher indicates that these were final test firing reports for the rockets and were issued in very limited numbers of no more than 10 to 12 copies. 'The present archive could prove to be a highly important new source of information on what was by far the most important technological and scientific development to have come from the Second World War. 'The V-2 was the first real ballistic missile. Its effects were devastating. Powerful: The first V-2 attack on Britain hit Chiswick in London in September 1944 and left a gigantic crater . 'Had Hitler been successful in developing the technology of the atomic bomb then he would have had the capability of firing it long distances. 'With the use of this rocket - unquestionably this would have led to the Nazis winning the war.' The document, which is typed on sheets of A4 paper, shows a large number of V-2 rockets were fired from the Peenemunde region where experimental devices were tested. They were fired against the Allies with missiles claiming thousands of lives in London, Antwerp and Liege. But shockingly, the reports also reveal many of the original test firings were at German towns and cities - mainly in the area of Pomerania. It is believed special units were then sent to evaluate the extent of the damage caused and report back to the Fuhrer about their effectiveness. Mr Westwood Brookes added: 'Perhaps the most remarkable fact which comes from these papers is that many of these test firings were fired at German targets. Devastation: A V-2 rocket attack left this block of flats in Limehouse, London, in ruins . 'This is evidence enough of how desperate the Nazis were becoming after D-Day and the relentless advances of Allied forces across Europe. 'Many of these test firings at German towns and cities resulted in considerable casualties and substantial damages to houses and other properties. 'I have never seen such concrete evidence to substantiate that Hitler actually used his own towns and cities as target practice.' After the war the majority of V-2-related documents were  destroyed by the Germans before the Allies moved in by orders of the SS. Mr Westwood-Brookes said: 'The fact that several of the sheets in the present archive have clearly been in a fire suggests that these very papers were rescued from such destruction. 'This really is an exceptionally rare find and one that offers a chilling insight into Hitler's war efforts during his final months.' The V-2 rocket was developed by Wernher von Braun, a German aerospace engineer and space architect. He was a member of the Nazi party but after the war went to work in America for Nasa and eventually helped develop the technology that put man on the moon in 1969. The V-2 was the most advanced weapon used in the war until the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Launched from mobile units, the 46ft (14m) tall rockets were powered by liquid ethanol and oxygen and weighed almost 13 tonnes, fully fuelled. The V-2s were also Hitler's answer to his country's disappointment that the V1s (or doodlebugs) didn't knock Britain out of the war. They were launched vertically and could travel at 3,335mph to hit targets more than 200 miles away, making it the world's first long-range combat-ballistic missile.","Most of the top-secret documents are written in coded German .

392bcc71bbf945945f1d6eb3a29902bbff80afae,"A toddler has been dubbed the real-life Elsa from the Disney film Frozen because she faces a daily battle to keep warm. Gracie Hughes, two, suffers from Raynaud's syndrome, and turns blue when she is exposed to the cold. The condition occurs when small blood vessels in the extremities are over-sensitive to changes in temperature, interrupting the blood supply. During an attack, the extremities become first white and dead looking and may then turn blue and finally red and burning when the blood flow is restored. The condition can cause considerable pain, numbness or tingling. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Gracie Hughes (with her mother Laurie) suffers from Raynaud's syndrome, which means she turns blue when she is exposed to the cold . Raynaud's occurs when small blood vessels in the extremities are over-sensitive to changes in temperature, interrupting the blood supply. Gracie is so badly affected she has been given special gloves for extra protection . During an attack, the extremities become first white and dead looking and may then turn blue and finally red and burning when the blood flow is restored . Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected. Gracie is so badly affected she has been given special gloves for extra protection. Her mother Laurie, 27, said: 'When she gets cold, she turns blotchy blue. It starts in her hands then travels up her arms, feet, legs then face. 'She has magic gloves which reflect 95 per cent of the heat back into her body.' Gracie's condition means even normal activities such as going outside can become a challenge, and she is not allowed to eat ice cream or consume very cold drinks. She doesn't leave the house without dressing in thermals, several layers, two pairs of socks and a hat and scarf - as well as her  silver gloves. 'The winter months are awful,' said her mother, who takes Gracie's temperature three times a day to check it doesn't drop too low. 'She can't go outside to play and now she is older can't eat ice cream or cold foods because her hands swell when she handles cold things. 'My heating is constantly on, and I have got her a heated blanket that I plug into the cigarette lighter which helps to keep her warm when we're in the car.' Gracie's condition means even normal activities such as going outside can become a challenge, and she is not allowed to eat ice cream or consume very cold drinks . Her mother said: 'When she gets cold, she turns blotchy blue. It starts in her hands then travels up her arms, feet, legs then face' Gracie also frequently suffers Raynaud's attacks at bath time. Her mother added: 'It's scary. People have stopped me in the street to say she's wrapped up too much and will overheat. 'While I want her to be a ""normal"" child, there are normal things that she just can't do. 'So it's a balance of letting her do all the other things little girls, while I'm permanently worried about her having an attack.' Gracie, from Barry, South Wales, was diagnosed with Raynaud's a year ago when she was 16 months old - despite her mother noticing from birth she was often cold and turning blue. Miss Hughes said: 'The worst I have seen is when her hands went almost black and looked like they were about to drop off. 'I was so worried because I was taking her to the doctor and the hospital but all the tests they were doing were coming back clear. 'They just kept telling me there was nothing wrong but I had a mother's instinct. Gracie is now learning to cope with the condition - helped by snow queen Elsa from the Disney film Frozen. Her mother said: 'Gracie absolutely loves Frozen and when I noticed that she was a bit like Elsa, she thought it was brilliant' Raynaud's condition, triggered by a sudden drop in temperature, causes the blood vessels in the fingers and toes contract, cutting off blood supply. It can also affect the tiny arteries in the nose, ears and tongue. Typically, Raynaud’s causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb. Then, as the blood flow returns, they turn blue and eventually red, accompanied by a burning sensation. Attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour. Nine out of ten cases are in women, with most sufferers having their first attack before the age of 40. Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms can be triggered by everyday tasks such as taking food out of the freezer, air conditioning, or even stress — all of which cause blood vessels to contract. There are two types of Raynaud’s. Primary Raynaud’s, which tends to run in families, is generally quite mild. Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected. 'She was finally seen by a rheumatologist at the hospital in Cardiff who told me what it was, which was great.' Gracie is now learning to cope with the condition - helped by snow queen Elsa from the animated film Frozen. Her mother said: 'Gracie absolutely loves Frozen and when I noticed that she was a bit like Elsa, she thought it was brilliant. 'She's getting to the age now where she doesn't understand why she has to wear gloves all the time so I tell her she's like Elsa and Elsa is special, which cheers her up. 'She loves being like Elsa, just like a real-life queen. 'There might be a day where she grows out of it and I hope that when she's older she can go out there and have a normal life. 'In the meantime it's just about teaching her how to deal with it so she can lead as much of a normal life as possible.' Liz Bevins, CEO of the Raynaud's & Scleroderma Association, said: 'Raynaud's can affect anyone of any age - babies, young children, adolescents, mature adults and the elderly. 'Cold hands and feet are frequently overlooked, put up with and considered nothing more than a nuisance but if you do suffer from cold extremities frequently, please don't ignore it. 'Some of the above diseases have silent phases, so you have very few symptoms or know no pain until the disease is in it's later stages. 'A few simple tests may be able to diagnose the above conditions much earlier, so we're encouraging you to go to your local GP and discuss any concerns you have , or get in touch with us for further help . 'Those looking after someone with the condition can also experience distress. We are here to help those people who suffer from the condition but also assist their families and carers to get the help and information they need.'

a7b6c16532675b79359657bf300c5190b3d03e98,"He's only just announced his plans to leave the Army but a new poll has revealed that the majority of Britons want Prince Harry to get back to work. But it isn't more royal duties that most have in mind. Instead, more than half say the Prince should combine official work with an 'ordinary' job. Harry is currently a captain in the Blues and Royals but will leave the Army this summer after a stint seconded to the Australian Defence Force. New job: The majority of Britons think Prince Harry should get another 'ordinary' job . Retirement: Harry announced that he will leave the Army this summer earlier this week . Deployment: Harry, who did two tours of duty in Afghanistan, will now spend four weeks with the Australian Defence Force in Sydney and Perth . The 30-year-old is due to fly to Australia next month and will follow his month-long deployment with an official tour of New Zealand. He will also travel back to this side of the world half way through to mark the Gallipoli centenary at a ceremony in Turkey alongside the Prince of Wales. Despite calls for the Prince to get a regular job, the majority of Britons say leaving the Army is the right decision. 56 per cent of those questioned by pollsters YouGov said the royal has made the right choice, compared to just eight per cent opposed. Harry, who has consistently topped royal popularity polls, was also deemed a good role model by the majority of those asked, with 61 per cent saying he is. An enthusiastic 22 per cent said the Prince is a 'very good' role model, with just four per cent saying he is a bad one and two per cent opting for 'very bad'. Although only 16 per cent believe Harry should concentrate exclusively on royal duties, his future beyond next autumn remains unclear. Along with announcing his decision to leave the Army, a statement from Kensington Palace revealed the Prince will travel to Africa this summer to take part in conservation and charity work. Yesterday, it was revealed that Harry will follow that with participation in the 1,000 mile 'Walk of Britain' alongside injured soldiers supported by Walking with the Wounded. The trek will be the third Walking with the Wounded expedition for Harry, who previously joined servicemen battling their way to the North Pole in 2011 and the South Pole in 2013. Next stop: Harry, pictured with the Kiwi Invictus team last September, will also tour New Zealand . Royal duties: Most think Harry should combine official work (pictured) with a regular job . Role model: Harry, who regularly tops royal popularity charts, is also considered a good role model by most . Speaking at the event yesterday, Harry reiterated his commitment to helping wounded veterans and also revealed that leaving the military would be 'challenging' for him. 'The public’s support for our Armed Forces continues to be extraordinary,' he added. 'However, as the memory of our military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan fade, we must encourage people to continue supporting our servicemen and women; particularly those who are seeking to transition into civilian life. 'This process can be challenging, as it is for anyone seeking a new career. As I make this transition myself, I'm determined to do all I can to help others.'","Majority of Britons say Prince Harry should get another 'ordinary' job .

Sunday marked the first day of Autumn, with Sydneysiders experiencing the change of seasons in dramatic fashion as a picturesque sunny sky turned stormy shortly after 3:30pm. Storms rolled in from the south, bringing with it 100km/h winds, torrential rain and hail across much of the city. Scroll down for video . Storms rolled into Sydney around 3:30pm, sending crowds scampering from Bondi Beach and other swimming spots across the city. Storms arrived from the south, bringing with them 100km/h winds, torrential rain and hail. Wind gusts of more than 100km/h took down power lines across the city. The storm caused chaos in the city, with train services disrupted by lightning strikes. Crowds of people soaking up some sun at Bondi Beach were forced to abandon the sand and head for cover when the storm hit. A sailboat caught in the storm slammed into the Manly Ferry, narrowly avoiding disaster. The city sweltered through scorching temperatures of up to 37 degrees for much of the day, extending the summer heat for an extra few hours. Temperatures hit 37 degrees before the storms arrived, making it the hottest start to Autumn in 11 years. Crowds flee the beach as clouds roll in. The weather is expected to return to normal on Monday, with a high of 26 forecast and only a 10 per cent chance of rain. Lightning strikes caused commuter chaos across the CBD, with train services disrupted. The extreme weather also sparked a fire on the roof of the The Rocks Hatters in George Street, forcing the street’s closure between Argyle Street and Hickson Road. It was the hottest March day in 11 years. Festival goers were also impacted by the wild weather, with The Good Life, an under-18’s music festival, forced to shut down. Crowds also abandoned the Soundwave festival because of the weather. The Good Life, an under-18s festival at Randwick Racecourse, was shut down by the weather. The average March temperature is just under 25 degrees. According to reports, festival organisers and police were concerned the main stage could be affected by the high winds.

7e92a4514c48259eed031998dd0e713f98a57b2c,"(CNN)A bill that would allow Utah to use firing squads to execute some death-row prisoners passed in the state Senate on Tuesday. The measure, which passed 18 to 10, will be sent to Gov. Gary Herbert, who has not said whether he will sign it into law or veto the bill. Herbert released a statement on the legislation, which would add death by firing squad as an option in a state that uses lethal injection. ""Our statute is clear that lethal injection is the method by which (an execution) will happen. We have no intent to change that,"" he said. The law would give the state the option to use a five-member squad in cases where the drugs necessary for lethal injection aren't available 30 days before the date set for the execution. ""Our state, as is the case with states around the country, is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the substances required to perform a lethal injection. We are dedicated to pursuing all reasonable and legal options to obtain those substances to make sure that, when required, we are in a position to carry out this very serious sentence by lethal injection,"" the governor said. Eight people are on Utah's death row. Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004, though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death. The last execution by firing squad was in 2010, and it was also the most recent execution in Utah. A Utah firing squad also executed Gary Gilmore in 1977, the first death by capital punishment after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the prior year. In recent years, states have struggled to maintain a supply of lethal injection drugs as manufacturers either stopped producing the drugs or barred their use in executions. Texas nearly out of execution drug . The European manufacturers of pentobarbital, an anesthetic, explicitly banned U.S. prisons from using its drug in executions. Some states have sought out substitutes or gone with one drug instead of the traditional three-drug cocktail. In April, Oklahoma used midazolam as a substitute for pentobarbital as part of a three-drug cocktail in an execution that went awry. Clayton Lockett, a convicted rapist and murderer, writhed and convulsed after the drugs were administered. It took 43 minutes for him to die. Last week, Georgia postponed an execution because the drugs appeared ""cloudy.""  The state also indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures, officials said. Georgia halts executions to analyze lethal drug cocktail . CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.","Firing squads were an option in Utah before they were banned in 2004 .
New law would allow them as execution method if proper drugs not available for lethal injection .
Many states are having problems getting the drugs ."
bfdd445f9770e61e2c7a4eb0134d4f4e83ab2e28,"Audley Harrison has revealed he is suffering from traumatic brain injuries and is facing bankruptcy after announcing his decision to retire from boxing. The heavyweight, who won Olympic gold in 2000, has not fought since he was knocked out by Deontay Wilder in 2013. And he aborted his latest comeback attempt after undergoing a battery of tests which produced some concerning results. Audley Harrison is suffering from traumatic brain injuries and is facing bankruptcy after retiring from boxing . Harrison says he has tried to focus and turn back the clock to get himself into fighting condition . James DeGale praised his fellow Olympic gold medalist Audley Harrison for putting amateur boxing 'on the map'. He said: 'He is the one who won the Olympic gold medal and helped boxing get the funding it has today. 'He put amateur boxing on the map and helped the next lot to come through. 'He had a fantastic career, he boxed for a world title and won the European title. All the best to him.' In a statement, Harrison said: 'I am no longer a professional boxer, and that is good with me. After locking myself away for the last five weeks, I've tried to focus and turn back the clock to get myself into fighting condition. 'I've also seen specialists for my brain, eyes and various other experts to test my body functions in regards to strength, power, speed, reaction time, cognitive function and agility. 'Additionally, I looked at the latest research into concussions and traumatic brain injuries (TBI). After years of denial and sticking to my guns, I'm finally getting out of my own way. 'I've suffered a few TBIs and will have to work hard to reverse some of the effects taking punches to the head has brought about to my overall health. 'I have vision problems, vestibular issues that lead to balance disturbances, and have serious bouts of irritability and moodiness that comes with TBI recovery.' The heavyweight, who won Olympic gold in 2000, has not fought since he was knocked out by Deontay Wilder . Wilder inflicted a first-round defeat on Harrison in 2013 which led to his retirement before he went back on it . Harrison initially retired following his first-round defeat by Wilder, who is now the WBC world champion. But he reversed that decision within days as he struggled to accept his career was over. Harrison also admitted he has been reckless with his earnings and could face bankruptcy in the UK. The 43-year-old currently lives in California and added: 'I've made many mistakes and learned some tough lessons along the way. I made tons of money and splurged lots of it away with reckless money management, immaturity and a desire to build my empire like Tony Montana. Harrison boxes against Paolo Vidoz on his way to winning Olympic gold at the games in Sydney in 2000 . Harrison plants a kiss on his gold medal in Sydney . 'Thankfully, my wife Raychel started a hair salon business and threw chunks of money into real estate, but I'll still likely have to file for bankruptcy in the UK. Thankfully, I invested in a pension while living in the UK, so that will be good when I'm much older. 'Without my boxing income, I will not be able to pay the huge tax bill I pay each year to satisfy the film partnership I invested into in 2004, and encashed my investment by 2009. The hefty tax bill each year does not finish until 2022.' Harrison started boxing at 19 and became the first British boxer to win Olympic gold in the super-heavyweight division when he triumphed in Sydney. His triumph paved the way for future medalists Amir Khan, James DeGale, Anthony Joshua, Luke Campbell and Nicola Adams through increased funding. He turned professional the following year, signing a £1million deal with the BBC for his first 10 fights. Six million people watched his debut - a first round knockout of Mike Middleton - but his contract was terminated in 2004 after he had accumulated a record of 17 wins from as many contests. Harrison suffered his first defeat when he challenged Danny Williams for the vacant Commonwealth title. Although he would later avenge that loss, it was the first of several high-profile bouts in which Harrison failed to produce the goods. Michael Sprott knocked him out in the third round of their European title clash - although that defeat was also avenged three years later in a rematch for the same belt. Harrison twice used the short-format Prizefighter to his advantage, first in 2009 when he defeated Coleman Barrett, Danny Hughes and Scott Belshaw. That propelled him into his second clash with Sprott which saw him finally win a major honour. The world title opportunity he so craved arrived in 2010 when he challenged David Haye for his WBA strap in Manchester. Six million people watched Harrison's professional debut - a first-round win over Mike Middleton on the BBC . But Harrison landed just one punch as he was dismantled inside three farcical rounds. The British Boxing Board of Control initially withheld some of his purse while a full investigation was carried out but he was later awarded the full amount. After 18 months in the doldrums, Harrison made a comeback against Ali Adams in 2012, a bout he won with a fourth-round knockout. And once again he earned himself a high-profile fight, this time against the British and Commonwealth champion David Price. Harrison gets revenge over Danny Williams for the Commonwealth title in 2006 after earlier losing out to him . But yet again, he was unable to walk the walk as the Liverpool giant knocked Harrison out cold after just 82 seconds. Those who urged him to retire were left disappointed when he again turned to Prizefighter for redemption in 2013. And his three victories over Derric Rossy, Martin Rogan and Claus Bertino produced his familiar rhetoric of finally being at one with himself and the sport. Harrison landed just one punch on David Haye as he was dismantled inside three farcical rounds . But in Wilder he faced another hurdle that could not be overcome. The American hope had knocked out all 27 of his previous opponents added another notch to his record when his right hand sent Harrison to the canvas for one last time after just 70 seconds. Harrison plans to start an agency to ensure boxers are given the financial advice he appears to have missed out on. He also intends to take out a trainer's license in California in a bid to develop a future champion. He said: 'If I'm to achieve my goal of becoming a world champion it will now have to be as a trainer and manager to a bright young star, who will hopefully learn from my mistakes, rather than learning from his or her own.'

d49c84983fafd5cbeb902adf7661000ffa2476c0,"Two savvy parents have made more than $1 million in ad revenue from their family-friendly YouTube videos, which feature footage of their children playing with toys such as Thomas the Tank Engine. Mark and Rhea, who prefer not to share their last name, upload videos starring their five-year-old son Hulyan, their three-year-old daughter Maya and their five-month-old son Marxlen to their popular YouTube channel Hulyan Maya, which currently receives more than 3 million views daily. 'In 2014, our YouTube income skyrocketed dramatically,' Mark told Yahoo Parents. 'We've made more than a million [dollars] between 2010 to 2014.' Scroll down for video . Home movies: Mark and Rhea, who prefer not to share their last name, filmed their daughter Maya, three, opening a Thomas & Friends Sodor Fix-It Station for their popular YouTube channel Hulyan Maya . Innocent adventure: The family's YouTube channel receives more than 3 million views daily . The father-of-three noted that they started their channel in 2007, but said that most of the old videos that they posted 'were junk'. They didn't begin sharing their money-making toy videos until three years later. The couple's most popular video was made in 2013 and features Hulyan buying a Thomas & Friends Emergency Searchlight set; the eight-minute clip has thus far earned more than 15.5 million views. Mark and Rhea, who are projected to earn at least $1.5 million this year, have since quit their jobs running an employment agency in order to pursue their lucrative YouTube careers full time. These days, they dedicate their time to filming, producing and sharing a minimum of two videos a day, which typically run for at least 15 minutes each. According to the duo, they've made so much money from the ads that air before each clip that they were able to pay for their cars and their house in Southern California in cash. They have even made enough to send all three of their children to college. Completely focused: The couple's son Hulyan can be seen playing a computer game . Ancient artifacts: The five-year-old can be seen opening a toy set filled with dinosaurs . And things don't seem to be slowing down. During the week of March 6, Hulyan Maya was ranked the 42nd most viewed YouTube channel in the US, according to Tubefilter, while a 20 minute video showing Maya unboxing a Thomas & Friends Sodor Fix-It Station, has already earned nearly 400,000 views since it was published last month. Throughout the clip she and her father go through the toys various features while unwrapping each piece and putting them together. Most of the children’s biggest fans appear to be young children who are around the same age as Maya and her older brother Hulyan – and share the same keen interest in their toys. 'I love your videos they really cheer up my son,' one parent wrote. Another added: 'Seriously though! My son loves them too!' Family fun: Rhea held baby Marxlen as Hulyan and Maya enjoyed a train ride . Dedicated dad: Mark shared these photos of himself at the start of one of his popular videos . Mark and Rhea, who go by 'ilovemaythang' on their channel, moved from the Phillippines to the US in 2000 and 2006, respectively. Their children's love of toys, including Thomas the Tank Engine, is what first inspired Mark to make a channel dedicated to their home movies. But even Mark, who has been making video blogs since the early 1990s, admits he could not have predicted just how lucrative the family hobby would become. '[It] exceeded my expectations,' he told Yahoo Parents. 'I knew and believed that it would become somehow successful, but more than three million views in a day is simply amazing. I'm living a dream.' But their popularity shouldn't be that shocking - children's toy reviews have quickly become some of YouTube's most-watched videos. According to industry experts, children who review new toys on YouTube are wielding increasing influence over the industry because of their incredible viewing figures and ability to sell almost any toy around. Marc Rosenberg, a Chicago-based toy consultant explained to the Associated Press last November: 'Kids trust other kids more so than they would an adult.’","Mark and Rhea, who prefer to keep their last names private, are expected to earn $1.5 million dollars from ad revenue in 2015 alone .
